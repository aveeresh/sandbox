Jan 17 03:34:21 <RammsteinFan>	why does sapphire not like you?
Jan 17 03:34:36 <RammsteinFan>	or az?
Jan 17 03:34:38 <DeWdRoPs>	She thinks LG is AZ and AZ is LG.
Jan 17 03:34:46 <RammsteinFan>	O.O
Jan 17 03:34:57 <DeWdRoPs>	And she thinks LG is flirting with me by using the nick AZ.
Jan 17 03:35:10 <DeWdRoPs>	She warned and I did not listen to her. I think that is why she is mad at me.
Jan 17 03:35:10 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jan 17 03:35:26 <RammsteinFan>	is this trivia or drama room?
Jan 17 03:35:41 <DeWdRoPs>	I have no clue, Veer.
Jan 17 03:35:51 <DeWdRoPs>	She used to talk to me before.
Jan 17 03:35:58 <DeWdRoPs>	But nowadays she don't.
Jan 17 03:36:01 <DeWdRoPs>	I asked LG
Jan 17 03:36:08 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jan 17 03:36:08 <DeWdRoPs>	And this is the reason he gave me.
Jan 17 03:36:35 <RammsteinFan>	i seriosuly dont know what is wrong with people
Jan 17 03:36:56 <DeWdRoPs>	She had told me before, "very soon you will know who is who"
Jan 17 03:37:05 <DeWdRoPs>	Then I did not know what she meant by that.
Jan 17 03:37:07 <DeWdRoPs>	Now I do.
Jan 17 03:37:25 <RammsteinFan>	hmm ok
Jan 17 03:37:52 <DeWdRoPs>	How can AZ and LG be the same person ?
Jan 17 03:38:00 <DeWdRoPs>	She can see that they both play and talk.
Jan 17 03:38:01 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jan 17 03:38:30 <RammsteinFan>	she is mad but az can tone it down a bit in main too
Jan 17 03:38:47 <RammsteinFan>	why unnecessarily make her angry?
Jan 17 03:38:49 <DeWdRoPs>	He is saying she took his Mom's name.
Jan 17 03:39:01 <RammsteinFan>	LG suffers coz of all this
Jan 17 03:39:28 <DeWdRoPs>	LG is saying that everything is going out of his hands. She abused him in the mains.
Jan 17 03:39:34 <DeWdRoPs>	What does she want, Veer ?
Jan 17 03:39:35 <RammsteinFan>	yaeh i was tehre

Jan 17 03:39:51 <RammsteinFan>	she wasnt talking to me before too
Jan 17 03:39:59 <RammsteinFan>	now she started talking to me
Jan 17 03:40:14 <DeWdRoPs>	No. I wasn't asking you. I was asking in general.
Jan 17 03:40:28 <RammsteinFan>	ok :)
Jan 17 03:40:44 <DeWdRoPs>	I hope everything gets cleared soon.
Jan 17 03:40:56 <DeWdRoPs>	Everyone is here to play and have fun and be happy.
Jan 17 03:41:01 <DeWdRoPs>	Hope it remains like that.
Jan 17 03:41:03 <RammsteinFan>	yeah this is what bothers me more
Jan 17 03:41:13 <RammsteinFan>	all this nonsense in main
Jan 17 03:41:52 <DeWdRoPs>	She really thinks AZ is LG, Veer.
Jan 17 03:42:07 <RammsteinFan>	yeah i know
Jan 17 03:42:09 <DeWdRoPs>	Hence she asked AZ to get a room and used that H word !!
Jan 17 03:42:11 <RammsteinFan>	she abused him earlier

Jan 17 03:42:23 <DeWdRoPs>	Hmmm.

Jan 17 03:43:00 <DeWdRoPs>	I asked him, Veer. But he has his own reasons !! Someone has to remain calm and handle things in a matured way.
Jan 17 03:43:17 <RammsteinFan>	both of them are immature...
Jan 17 03:43:23 <RammsteinFan>	thats why all this nonsense
Jan 17 03:43:35 <RammsteinFan>	and poor LG endds up suffering
Jan 17 03:43:59 <DeWdRoPs>	The one thing I don't understand is, how can two people be in the same room, chatting and playing ?
Jan 17 03:44:04 <DeWdRoPs>	She can think about it.
Jan 17 03:44:33 <RammsteinFan>	yeah that being unreasonable

Jan 17 03:48:25 <DeWdRoPs>	I am not saying its her fault. She can talk to me and ask me before judging or coming to such conclusions.
Jan 17 03:48:27 <RammsteinFan>	so its not like sapphire is all at fault
Jan 17 03:48:39 <DeWdRoPs>	And LG wouldn't let me talk to her.

Feb 18 20:12:12 <RammsteinFan>	Gust Avrakotos: There's a little boy and on his 14th birthday he gets a horse... and everybody in the village says, "how wonderful. The boy got a horse" And the Zen master says, "we'll see." Two years later, the boy falls off the horse, breaks his leg, and everyone in the village says, "How terrible." And the Zen master says, "We'll see." Then, a war breaks out and all the young men have to go off 
Feb 18 20:12:12 <RammsteinFan>	and fight... except the boy can't cause his legs all messed up. and everybody in the village says, "How wonderful."
Feb 18 20:12:12 <RammsteinFan>	Charlie Wilson: Now the Zen master says, "We'll see."
Feb 18 20:12:15 <RammsteinFan>	ok here it is
Feb 18 20:14:40 <RammsteinFan>	?
Feb 18 20:14:49 <DeWdRoPs>	Hmmmm.. Reading it again.

Feb 18 20:15:46 <DeWdRoPs>	The story ends there ??
Feb 18 20:15:46 <RammsteinFan>	:)
Feb 18 20:15:52 <RammsteinFan>	yes lol
Feb 18 20:16:08 <RammsteinFan>	sorry but you didnt get it?
Feb 18 20:16:28 <DeWdRoPs>	It means everything that happens, it happens for a reason ?
Feb 18 20:16:32 <RammsteinFan>	nope
Feb 18 20:16:42 <RammsteinFan>	it means nothing is good or bad
Feb 18 20:16:59 <DeWdRoPs>	Good and bad are just "relative" terms ?
Feb 18 20:17:03 <RammsteinFan>	something you think is good could be bad later and something which you think is bad can be good
Feb 18 20:17:06 <RammsteinFan>	yep
Feb 18 20:17:08 <DeWdRoPs>	It depends on how we perceive it ?
Feb 18 20:17:12 <RammsteinFan>	just depends on situation
Feb 18 20:17:15 <DeWdRoPs>	ie*
Feb 18 20:17:26 <DeWdRoPs>	Yessss. It makes sense now.
Feb 18 20:17:39 <RammsteinFan>	the boy gets a horse...is good...but laters falls off the horse and break his leg...bad
Feb 18 20:17:51 <RammsteinFan>	war break out and he doenst have to go...good
Feb 18 20:18:07 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes. If he didn't break his legs, he would have gone to the war.
Feb 18 20:18:09 <RammsteinFan>	so the zen master always says "we'll see"
Feb 18 20:18:12 <RammsteinFan>	yep
Feb 18 20:18:15 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes.
Feb 18 20:18:29 <RammsteinFan>	you never know what can happen later
Feb 18 20:18:41 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes, Veeeer. Now I completely understand :)
Feb 18 20:18:48 <RammsteinFan>	so never judge in the moment if the moment is good or bad :)
Feb 18 20:18:52 <RammsteinFan>	good :)

May 18 18:20:33 <RammsteinFan>	you dont have to put up with any nonsesne
May 18 18:20:48 <DeWdRoPs>	She asked me to give her his e-mail and I said I can't.
May 18 18:20:54 <DeWdRoPs>	So she said I am very rude.
May 18 18:20:58 <RammsteinFan>	lol
May 18 18:21:01 <RammsteinFan>	ignore her then
May 18 18:21:07 <RammsteinFan>	tell her to ask AZ himself
May 18 18:21:18 <DeWdRoPs>	But Ishita is AZ !!!!!
May 18 18:21:20 <RammsteinFan>	ask her why is she asking you for his email
May 18 18:21:22 <RammsteinFan>	yeah i know
May 18 18:21:26 <DeWdRoPs>	I did.
May 18 18:21:26 <RammsteinFan>	so ask her that!
May 18 18:21:40 <RammsteinFan>	what an idiot looool
May 18 18:21:51 <DeWdRoPs>	Then she told me that they are very close friends and he is not to be seen here and asked me if I had any idea what happened to him.
May 18 18:22:02 <RammsteinFan>	he needs to see a psychatrist
May 18 18:22:21 <RammsteinFan>	tell her you are not his babysitter
May 18 18:22:37 <DeWdRoPs>	I told him the same the other day, Veeeeer. I felt bad afterwards, but I just could not control my anger and I was deeply hurt.
May 18 18:22:53 <RammsteinFan>	you dont need to feel sorry for him
May 18 18:22:54 <DeWdRoPs>	I told him that he need help and he should get some help sooon.
May 18 18:22:58 <RammsteinFan>	he gets what he deserves
May 18 18:23:21 <RammsteinFan>	if he acts this way how can anyone be nice to him
May 18 18:23:27 <DeWdRoPs>	I can never ever forgive him for what he has done. Blame me for trusting him so much.
May 18 18:23:46 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes, Veeeeer. I know. And I always tried to make him understand that.
May 18 18:23:51 <RammsteinFan>	hoppy told me he is coming into the room and telling his nonsense story to everyone in here
May 18 18:24:02 <DeWdRoPs>	He just don't like me talking to you or hoppy :-/
May 18 18:24:18 <RammsteinFan>	next time you get a pm just ignore it..dont even reply
May 18 18:24:31 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes. I will not. Enough of it already.
May 18 18:24:52 <RammsteinFan>	yes he has always been like that...doesnt like anyone talkin to you
May 18 18:25:14 <RammsteinFan>	he is also responsible for LG not coming her anymore
May 18 18:25:22 <DeWdRoPs>	But I am an individual and I have the right to talk to anyone I want.
May 18 18:25:28 <RammsteinFan>	yes exactly
May 18 18:25:33 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes, Veeeer. Only now I came to know of it !
May 18 18:25:44 <RammsteinFan>	hmmm
May 18 18:26:06 <DeWdRoPs>	I should be blamed. I gave him too much importance in my life. I trusted him blindly.
May 18 18:26:15 <DeWdRoPs>	I thought he is a kiddo.
May 18 18:26:19 <DeWdRoPs>	Immature.
May 18 18:26:31 <RammsteinFan>	yes
May 18 18:26:43 <RammsteinFan>	teena says the same thing about him
May 18 18:27:00 <RammsteinFan>	she doesnt know what all he has done
May 18 18:27:17 <RammsteinFan>	and dont blame yourself
May 18 18:27:24 <RammsteinFan>	how were you supposed to know
May 18 18:27:24 <DeWdRoPs>	Yes, Veeeeeer. He is a kiddo. Immature too. He doesn't realize about the consequences of his actions.
May 18 18:27:37 <RammsteinFan>	he isnt a kiddo...23 is not a kiddo
May 18 18:27:42 <RammsteinFan>	13 is but not 23
May 18 18:27:57 <RammsteinFan>	and even if he was he should learn after people have told him
May 18 18:28:02 <DeWdRoPs>	True that. But I thought of him as a kiddo and kept forgiving his mistakes.
May 18 18:28:10 <RammsteinFan>	being young is no excuse to act this way
May 18 18:28:18 <DeWdRoPs>	I must have tried to make him understand a billion times.
May 18 18:28:26 <RammsteinFan>	yes which i think you should not have
May 18 18:28:39 <RammsteinFan>	some people are beyond understanding nazu
May 18 18:28:48 <DeWdRoPs>	He would never accept that he is possessive. He would call it being 'protective' !
May 18 18:28:54 <DeWdRoPs>	I understand that now, Veeeer.
May 18 18:29:00 <RammsteinFan>	i did the same thing the first time he pulled some nonsense
May 18 18:29:18 <RammsteinFan>	after that i just ignored him
May 18 18:29:21 <DeWdRoPs>	Hmmmm.
May 18 18:29:37 <RammsteinFan>	then LG told me what all he did 
May 18 18:29:47 <DeWdRoPs>	I have noticed that, whenever he has problems with anyone, he would drag me into it too.
May 18 18:29:55 <RammsteinFan>	after that i didnt even want to be in the same room as him
May 18 18:29:58 <DeWdRoPs>	Hmmm. I know. LG has suffered a lot.
May 18 18:30:17 <RammsteinFan>	yes he has...a lot!
May 18 18:30:28 <RammsteinFan>	and all because AZ cant keep his mouth shut
May 18 18:30:53 <RammsteinFan>	and that too in matters in which he absolutely SHOULD keep his mouth shut
May 18 18:30:57 <DeWdRoPs>	As I told you, he doesn't want me talking to anyone ! But I was here in this room before he started coming here. So how should I be in danger ?? I know you all before I know him.
May 18 18:31:08 <DeWdRoPs>	Yesss. That's been his problem.
May 18 18:31:16 <RammsteinFan>	lol why would you be in danger? 
May 18 18:31:24 <DeWdRoPs>	He thinks so. I don't.
May 18 18:31:28 <RammsteinFan>	lol
May 18 18:31:32 <RammsteinFan>	what a doofus
May 18 18:31:50 <RammsteinFan>	he needs to get his head examined by a doctor
May 18 18:32:12 <DeWdRoPs>	But I am hurt, Veeeeeer. I could never imagine someone who calls me his best friend would do such a thing to me.
May 18 18:32:24 <DeWdRoPs>	I told him the same. I was so mad that day.
May 18 18:32:38 <RammsteinFan>	i know you are but now that you know you need to stop blaming yourself
May 18 18:33:01 <DeWdRoPs>	Yesss. I need to be cautious and careful about investing my emotions.
May 18 18:33:11 <DeWdRoPs>	Hope I learn, Veeeeeeeeer.
May 18 18:33:17 <DeWdRoPs>	Inshallah, I will learn.
May 18 18:33:39 <RammsteinFan>	yes
May 18 18:33:57 <DeWdRoPs>	And now I have the wisdom tooth. Ahem :D
May 18 18:33:57 <RammsteinFan>	you need to first stop blaming yourself
May 18 18:34:01 <RammsteinFan>	lol yes
May 18 18:34:05 <RammsteinFan>	good for you :)
May 18 18:34:20 <DeWdRoPs>	Yess. I will not blame myself. Mistakes happen. But we have to learn from them.
May 18 18:34:24 <DeWdRoPs>	And I will.
May 18 18:34:34 <RammsteinFan>	yeah
May 18 18:34:51 <RammsteinFan>	you thought he was kiddish but he is kinda evil if you ask me
May 18 18:35:19 <DeWdRoPs>	You have warned me. I do remember, when I told you that I shared my email id with him
May 18 18:35:29 <DeWdRoPs>	I was blind, I guess.
May 18 18:35:39 <RammsteinFan>	yes i knew what he was like...but you didnt listen then
May 18 18:35:46 <RammsteinFan>	yeah i gues
May 18 18:36:05 <DeWdRoPs>	I know, Veeeeer. I was blind. I could only see good things then.
May 18 18:36:28 <RammsteinFan>	dragon used to get pings from AZ when he dragon hugged you in main
May 18 18:36:31 <RammsteinFan>	LG told me this
May 18 18:36:39 <DeWdRoPs>	Oh yess. I know. OMG.
May 18 18:36:45 <DeWdRoPs>	He used to fight with me for that.
May 18 18:36:46 <RammsteinFan>	yes you have never met such people before so how can you know
May 18 18:37:05 <RammsteinFan>	and yet you thought he was a kid? :)
May 18 18:37:14 <RammsteinFan>	you are very naive
May 18 18:37:16 <DeWdRoPs>	I thought it was kiddish.
May 18 18:37:25 <DeWdRoPs>	Fighting for such silly reasons.
May 18 18:37:40 <RammsteinFan>	its not..its a sign that your head is not right...so now you know
May 18 18:37:59 <DeWdRoPs>	Friends do hug each other. Why should it be taken otherwise ??
May 18 18:38:06 <DeWdRoPs>	Hmmm. Yes. Now I know.
May 18 18:38:24 <DeWdRoPs>	And whenever a new user talks to me, I have a certain fear.
May 18 18:38:47 <RammsteinFan>	yes
May 18 18:38:54 <RammsteinFan>	friends hug each other
May 18 18:39:11 <RammsteinFan>	if he cant understand that he should be left alone
May 18 18:39:46 <RammsteinFan>	believe me any person who tries to manipulate you or control you isnt worth it
May 18 18:40:23 <DeWdRoPs>	Yesss Veeer.
May 18 18:40:31 <DeWdRoPs>	They aren't worth it.
May 18 18:40:40 <RammsteinFan>	yes
May 18 18:40:45 <DeWdRoPs>	It is AZ who played games with me and he is calling me a backstabber.
May 18 18:40:57 <RammsteinFan>	lol
May 18 18:41:05 <RammsteinFan>	mighty rich 
May 18 18:41:25 <DeWdRoPs>	You, hoppy and me.. We three planned a game against him, is what he says.
May 18 18:41:53 <RammsteinFan>	i can put him in his place but then again he has a habit to go whine to everyone 
May 18 18:41:59 <DeWdRoPs>	And for him, Dew is the biggest backstabber !!!
May 18 18:42:01 <RammsteinFan>	and people like drama so they let him talk
May 18 18:42:07 <DeWdRoPs>	I know.
May 18 18:42:13 <DeWdRoPs>	Let's just leave it, Veeeeer.
May 18 18:42:15 <RammsteinFan>	ignore what he says
May 18 18:42:21 <RammsteinFan>	he isnt worth your time
May 18 18:42:35 <DeWdRoPs>	I know.
May 18 18:42:39 <RammsteinFan>	when he comes to his senses he will realise he lost a good friend who always listened to him
May 18 18:43:01 <RammsteinFan>	that time he will realise his mistake
May 18 18:43:23 <DeWdRoPs>	Who knows ! Maybe he will always think of me as a backstabber. But I know and Allah knows that I have always and only wished him good.
May 18 18:43:30 <RammsteinFan>	yes
