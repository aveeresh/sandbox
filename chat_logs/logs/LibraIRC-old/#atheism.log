Dec 01 00:16:00 <Joshtice>	look at this list
Dec 01 00:16:13 <Banagher>	We're third
Dec 01 00:16:20 <Banagher>	Honestly, we should be one of the top nations
Dec 01 00:16:21 <Joshtice>	All of the shitty oil rich countries teamed up to form OPEC
Dec 01 00:16:23 <Banagher>	First
Dec 01 00:16:36 <Joshtice>	which is an international cabal that controls oil supply and prices around the world
Dec 01 00:16:36 <Joshtice>	lol
Dec 01 00:16:52 <Banagher>	But not the prices of America and Russia?
Dec 01 00:16:54 <NoWarNoFear>	Ok so it's an atheism room or an anti-muslim room?
Dec 01 00:16:55 <Joshtice>	US is the third biggest producer of oil according to this
Dec 01 00:17:02 <Joshtice>	Yes
Dec 01 00:17:07 <Banagher>	NoWarNoFear, honestly, it's just a room for intellectuals
Dec 01 00:17:09 <Joshtice>	international price is US price too

Dec 01 00:17:14 <Joshtice>	I am us company
Dec 01 00:17:15 <Banagher>	I can't recall the last time we had a serious discussion about religion
Dec 01 00:17:17 <Joshtice>	I need to buy oil
Dec 01 00:17:30 <Joshtice>	OPEC country offers to sell it to me at 40$ a barrel since they make it at 20$ a barrel
Dec 01 00:17:31 <NoWarNoFear>	Joshtice: U admit u never read...so how can u be an intellectual?
Dec 01 00:17:35 <Joshtice>	I buy it from OPEC country
Dec 01 00:18:08 <Joshtice>	over US company that has to sell it at 60$ a barrel or can't make a cent in profit
Dec 01 00:18:42 <Joshtice>	So now that everyone can buy from OPEC countries at 40$ a barrel, they won't pay more than that to buy US oil
Dec 01 00:18:43 <NoWarNoFear>	sorry i was targeted Banagher about the reading
Dec 01 00:18:47 <Joshtice>	that's how the international market works

Dec 01 00:21:34 <NoWarNoFear>	It's funny how Banagher was agaisnt Joshtice  few months ago and now they are befriended because they both support laws agaisnt mexicans and muslims...
Dec 01 00:21:47 <Banagher>	NoWarNoFear, that is fucking RIDICULOUS
Dec 01 00:21:50 <Joshtice>	price of fuel goes up
Dec 01 00:21:58 <UberKing>	now he is repeating the same shit he tried to explain to the self proclaimed "economic genius" 10 minutes ago
Dec 01 00:21:59 <UberKing>	lulz
Dec 01 00:22:07 <Joshtice>	who uberking
Dec 01 00:22:08 <Banagher>	Why are you for Muslims?
Dec 01 00:22:08 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: I am forthright...I tell it like it is
Dec 01 00:22:14 <Banagher>	They oppress women and homosexuals
Dec 01 00:22:20 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: Not all
Dec 01 00:22:25 <NoWarNoFear>	Only fanatics
Dec 01 00:22:25 <Joshtice>	Banagher is obviously not an economics genius, uberking
Dec 01 00:22:28 <UberKing>	NoWar this is a neo facist room btw
Dec 01 00:22:29 <Banagher>	If they could they would
Dec 01 00:22:39 <NoWarNoFear>	UberKing: I'm noticing that
Dec 01 00:22:53 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: Are you psychic? have u meet all of them?
Dec 01 00:23:01 <NoWarNoFear>	Enough of the so called psychic
Dec 01 00:23:12 <NoWarNoFear>	If u have psychic powers, first prove it to me
Dec 01 00:23:21 <UberKing>	the convos between the backboneless one and the economic genuis are THE lulz
Dec 01 00:23:24 <Banagher>	NoWarNoFear, if it's not the case, then why do countries ruled by Muslims oppress homosexuals and women?
Dec 01 00:23:33 <Joshtice>	that's why the economist i was talking about way before said that he thinks that an oil price of 60-80$/barrel is best for Canada
Dec 01 00:23:38 <Banagher>	The majority of muslims in this country and in our own country are not against this
Dec 01 00:23:42 <Joshtice>	Good enough for oil companies to be profitable
Dec 01 00:23:50 <Joshtice>	but doesn't make fuel prices too expensive for everyone else
Dec 01 00:23:53 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: Really how you know? you read their minds?
Dec 01 00:23:53 <UberKing>	USa has a lot of hate crime btw
Dec 01 00:24:03 <UberKing>	USA is famous for hate crimes
Dec 01 00:24:10 <Banagher>	Look at the statistics, dude
Dec 01 00:24:14 <Joshtice>	Germany is famous for hate crimes tool
Dec 01 00:24:16 <Joshtice>	too
Dec 01 00:24:25 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: KKK are christians fanatic...Do we confuse them with all the christians?
Dec 01 00:24:30 <UberKing>	not really
Dec 01 00:24:31 <Joshtice>	they've been apologizing for it for a good part of the last century lol
Dec 01 00:24:39 <UberKing>	your media makes it so
Dec 01 00:24:40 <UberKing>	haha
Dec 01 00:24:43 <Banagher>	There is a law in Iran where women can only report a rape if there are a certain number of male witnesses
Dec 01 00:24:50 <Joshtice>	There hasn't been a "genocide" in the US for centuries
Dec 01 00:24:53 <UberKing>	your media is not really up to parr is it?
Dec 01 00:25:02 <Joshtice>	there was the biggest recorded genocide in world history in Germany within the last century
Dec 01 00:25:06 <Joshtice>	get off your high horse
Dec 01 00:25:09 <UberKing>	oh that
Dec 01 00:25:10 <Banagher>	NoWarNoFear, you'd be hard-pressed to find a Muslim who doesn't want some form of Shariah Law implemented in western society.
Dec 01 00:25:14 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: Iran laws are made by a minority
Dec 01 00:25:17 <UberKing>	that was 80 years ago
Dec 01 00:25:23 <UberKing>	is that all you got?
Dec 01 00:25:29 <UberKing>	haha
Dec 01 00:25:30 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: prove you a telepath
Dec 01 00:25:39 <NoWarNoFear>	Psychics are charlatans
Dec 01 00:25:46 <UberKing>	banagher believes US media
Dec 01 00:25:57 <NoWarNoFear>	It's easy to claim to can read people mind
Dec 01 00:26:02 <UberKing>	Trumpty is a media pro
Dec 01 00:26:11 <Joshtice>	A lot of the race conflicts and hates is PERPETUATED by the US media UberKing
Dec 01 00:26:15 <Joshtice>	and it catches on in international media
Dec 01 00:26:18 <UberKing>	Trumpty uses the US media very very well
Dec 01 00:26:23 <Joshtice>	based on them cherry picking from US media
Dec 01 00:26:30 <Banagher>	NoWarNoFear, well, for me it's not about reading minds. It's about simple math and empathy. Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is having war waged against his religion and people.
Dec 01 00:26:36 <UberKing>	not in my country
Dec 01 00:27:00 <Banagher>	A person who has had his home country and relatives bombed by Western people as they go on about and live in relative prosperity.
Dec 01 00:27:04 <UberKing>	as if USA gave a flying fuck about muslim countries
Dec 01 00:27:05 <Joshtice>	German media is probably just as biased lol
Dec 01 00:27:19 <Banagher>	Would you not feel resentful towards the west?
Dec 01 00:27:57 <UberKing>	Germans have not forgotten the US & UK carpet bombing of its civilians
Dec 01 00:28:00 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: Empathy and telepathy are not science
Dec 01 00:28:10 <Joshtice>	Banagher: and then they begin their required sectarian shia/sunni civil war every few decades
Dec 01 00:28:17 <Banagher>	You want to import a million men like this into your country and maybe a few will be really productive and contribute a lot, but a lot will be resentful and it will be a risk
Dec 01 00:28:19 <Joshtice>	that kills orders of more magnitude more people 
Dec 01 00:28:30 <UberKing>	that is actually all USA has ever been good at - bombing civilians
Dec 01 00:28:31 <Banagher>	It will be a HUGE unnecessary risk
Dec 01 00:28:46 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: The problem with fanatics is Wahabism from Saoudia which have been supported by Republicans through the years
Dec 01 00:29:07 <NoWarNoFear>	Banagher: So by supporting republicans you are suspicious yourself
Dec 01 00:29:26 <UberKing>	banagher hates his own laws and here he thinks he has a clue about them
Dec 01 00:29:29 <UberKing>	what a joke
Dec 01 00:29:31 <Joshtice>	Well, there has been a shady alliance between the US and Saudi Arabia
Dec 01 00:29:33 <NoWarNoFear>	UberKing: yeah
Dec 01 00:29:44 <Banagher>	It's too risky to import Muslims from other countries while waging war with Islamist extremism - it makes no sense to do that
Dec 01 00:29:46 <Joshtice>	while Saudi Arabia is simultaneously involved in funding a lot of international terrorism that opposes the US
Dec 01 00:29:56 <NoWarNoFear>	Joshtice: Like the motto says 'Who says nothing, agrees"
Dec 01 00:30:00 <Joshtice>	it's a 20194 DIMENSIONAL hegelian dialectic in action, uberking
Dec 01 00:30:05 <NoWarNoFear>	so big responsability here
Dec 01 00:30:16 <UberKing>	TRumpty Dumpty will even implement more laws allowing his gov't to spy on his yankees 
Dec 01 00:30:29 <Joshtice>	UberKing
Dec 01 00:30:31 <Joshtice>	which is bad
Dec 01 00:30:46 <Joshtice>	but both parties are doing that
Dec 01 00:30:52 <NoWarNoFear>	People should fight fanatism not innocent women and childreen
Dec 01 00:30:55 <NoWarNoFear>	period
Dec 01 00:30:56 <Joshtice>	Obama did not decrease spying on civilians compared to Bush
Dec 01 00:30:59 <Joshtice>	if anything, he increased it
Dec 01 00:31:04 <Joshtice>	and Clinton would have continued that further
Dec 01 00:31:05 <Banagher>	I will take a picture of my book shelf
Dec 01 00:31:09 <Joshtice>	probably even worse than Trump
Dec 01 00:31:20 <UberKing>	rofl in US of A more than 30 00o die of gun shots a year....how many from terroroism? 50? 100? 200? 300?
Dec 01 00:31:24 <UberKing>	what a joke
Dec 01 00:31:56 <UberKing>	GW implemented the Patrioc Act

Dec 01 00:43:15 <Joshtice>	NoWarNoFear: you have become more aggressive
Dec 01 00:43:17 <LittleStar>	Ada, what makes u think he likes me? we are just friends
Dec 01 00:43:23 <NoWarNoFear>	Joshtice: I'm not
Dec 01 00:43:26 <Joshtice>	he is not less american than a Mexican American
Dec 01 00:43:32 <Joshtice>	that's the distinction that you don't understand
Dec 01 00:43:36 <NoWarNoFear>	Joshtice: Not less but not more
Dec 01 00:43:41 <NoWarNoFear>	That was my point
Dec 01 00:43:43 <UberKing>	he thinks that black people in USA were better off in 1960s
Dec 01 00:43:45 <NoWarNoFear>	Not less not more
Dec 01 00:43:47 <Joshtice>	NoWarNoFear
Dec 01 00:43:57 <Joshtice>	if you actually understand what is going on, it's a debate on illegal immigration
Dec 01 00:44:03 <NoWarNoFear>	UberKing: What? he said that?
Dec 01 00:44:04 <Joshtice>	some people involved are racist
Dec 01 00:44:06 <bittersweet>	Hey
Dec 01 00:44:24 <UberKing>	that is one of the harmless things he said
Dec 01 00:44:35 <NoWarNoFear>	Joshtice: I was not into the illegal immegration matter, i was speaking of legal citizenship
Dec 01 00:44:42 <Joshtice>	but the actual issue is whether or not open borders and pseudo-automatic citizenship are acceptable for the United States
Dec 01 00:45:03 <NoWarNoFear>	Joshtice: U can be agaisnt illegals without being racist
Dec 01 00:45:06 <UberKing>	what is pseudo automatic citizenship?
Dec 01 00:45:17 <Joshtice>	UberKing: Plans for amnesty in the future
Dec 01 00:45:27 <NoWarNoFear>	Being born and raised in a country and having respecting the law
Dec 01 00:45:37 <Joshtice>	It's inevitable for example that most of the mexican illegals will be granted legal status, uberking
Dec 01 00:45:52 <NoWarNoFear>	You make me depressed
Dec 01 00:45:53 <Joshtice>	but doing so while not securing the border makes it pseudo-legal status
Dec 01 00:45:55 <NoWarNoFear>	I'm feel bad
Dec 01 00:45:59 <UberKing>	never heard of that
Dec 01 00:46:01 <NoWarNoFear>	I will have more insomnias 
Dec 01 00:46:02 <NoWarNoFear>	now
Dec 01 00:46:05 <NoWarNoFear>	It's your fault
Dec 01 00:46:06 <Joshtice>	uberking: it has been done before
Dec 01 00:46:06 <NoWarNoFear>	!
Dec 01 00:46:08 <Joshtice>	iirc
Dec 01 00:46:16 <NoWarNoFear>	U are destroying my mental health
Dec 01 00:46:18 <Joshtice>	Reagan legalized a lot of illegal mexican immigrants for example lol
Dec 01 00:46:26 <Joshtice>	let me look it
Dec 01 00:46:38 <UberKing>	i do not click links
Dec 01 00:46:58 <NoWarNoFear>	Illegal issues has nothing to do with racism
Dec 01 00:47:05 <NoWarNoFear>	But there is a racism problem
Dec 01 00:47:11 <NoWarNoFear>	Let's be honest
Dec 01 00:47:28 <UberKing>	the idiot wants to deport 3 instead of 11 million now
Dec 01 00:47:31 <UberKing>	rol
Dec 01 00:47:34 <UberKing>	where to?
Dec 01 00:47:35 <Joshtice>	Amnesty has been part of the discussion on illegal immigration in the US for decades
Dec 01 00:47:58 <NoWarNoFear>	Instead of deporting why not creating jobs
Dec 01 00:48:03 <NoWarNoFear>	where are the jobs?
Dec 01 00:48:11 <NoWarNoFear>	how to stop mass shooting?
Dec 01 00:48:15 <NoWarNoFear>	that's real issues
Dec 01 00:48:24 <NoWarNoFear>	Not the mexican doritos or tacos issues
Dec 01 00:48:31 <UberKing>	nothing will everr change in USA
Dec 01 00:48:47 <UberKing>	now Trumpty will isolate the country
Dec 01 00:49:02 <NoWarNoFear>	Jobs are the crucial matter , but policians avoid it

Dec 01 00:49:11 <PandorasBox>	Wikipedia » Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986: The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), Pub.L. 99–603, 100 Stat. …
Dec 01 00:49:16 <Joshtice>	This was the famous act signed by reagan
Dec 01 00:49:18 <UberKing>	he cannot bring back outsourced jobs
Dec 01 00:49:45 <NoWarNoFear>	Singapore or Dubai are multicultural and very secured because of a strong job market
Dec 01 00:49:47 <NoWarNoFear>	so jobs
Dec 01 00:49:51 <NoWarNoFear>	are the key
Dec 01 00:49:57 <NoWarNoFear>	jobs= social peace
Dec 01 00:49:59 <NoWarNoFear>	period
Dec 01 00:50:19 <UberKing>	as if Apple would start poroducing its products in US
Dec 01 00:50:36 <UberKing>	what bs
Dec 01 00:51:00 <Joshtice>	NoWarNoFear
Dec 01 00:51:05 <NoWarNoFear>	All those tensions everywhere are worrying, i'm afraid a global war would start
