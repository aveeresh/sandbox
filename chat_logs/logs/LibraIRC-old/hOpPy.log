Nov 18 19:33:32 <hOpPy>	ok

Nov 18 19:34:06 <hOpPy>	thats enough. Next time the log will be on
Nov 18 19:34:15 <RammsteinFan>	good :)
Nov 18 19:34:26 <RammsteinFan>	he was banned earlier..dunno how he came back in
Nov 18 19:34:26 <hOpPy>	One more and he'll be banned
Nov 18 19:34:33 <RammsteinFan>	ok
Nov 18 19:34:44 <hOpPy>	Dragon got told to let him back in
Nov 18 19:34:59 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Nov 18 19:35:12 <RammsteinFan>	by whom?
Nov 18 19:35:22 <hOpPy>	persons unknown
Nov 18 19:35:30 <RammsteinFan>	hmm i see
Nov 18 19:35:41 <RammsteinFan>	well fred should be banned for life
Nov 18 19:35:49 <hOpPy>	difficult...
Nov 18 19:35:53 <RammsteinFan>	hes been abusive towards most of the people here
Nov 18 19:36:06 <RammsteinFan>	why is it difficult?
Nov 18 19:36:23 <hOpPy>	I won't hesitate but at the end of the day it's still Dragons channel
Nov 18 19:36:30 <RammsteinFan>	ah i see...sure
Nov 18 19:36:33 <RammsteinFan>	i get it
Nov 18 19:37:02 <hOpPy>	and remember the LibraIRC people hardly ever give permanent bans
Nov 18 19:37:19 <RammsteinFan>	alright
Nov 18 19:37:22 <hOpPy>	A clever person can defeat bans
Nov 18 19:37:31 <RammsteinFan>	well for repeated offender there shold be one though
Nov 18 19:37:43 <RammsteinFan>	yes clever people do that
Nov 18 19:38:00 <hOpPy>	happened to me before where someone was in control of many many IP addresses
Nov 18 19:38:09 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Nov 18 19:38:12 <hOpPy>	so any ban was meaningless
Nov 18 19:38:19 <hOpPy>	so, I gave up
Nov 18 19:38:21 <RammsteinFan>	well sure in this case bans wont work
Nov 18 19:38:41 <hOpPy>	that guy is still around too
Nov 18 19:38:56 <hOpPy>	they know about him but do nothing
Nov 18 19:39:05 <RammsteinFan>	well yes thats to be expected

Nov 29 18:15:37 <RammsteinFan>	thats up to you to judge
Nov 29 18:15:48 <hOpPy>	He was very close to being told
Nov 29 18:15:57 <RammsteinFan>	you just send me the file and let me know what i can do to help

Nov 29 18:17:00 <RammsteinFan>	ah ok
Nov 29 18:17:34 <hOpPy>	yes. easy to hang it on the ops and criticise, let's see him do the work
Nov 29 18:17:40 <RammsteinFan>	i can look up on the internet and fix the qs
Nov 29 18:18:02 <RammsteinFan>	will be a lot of work i agree but we do need to start somewhere

Nov 29 18:20:19 <RammsteinFan>	hmm

Nov 29 18:20:42 <hOpPy>	hmmm

May 08 13:54:50 <RammsteinFan>	heeheh
May 08 13:55:00 <RammsteinFan>	be careful what you wish for
May 08 13:55:10 <hoppy>	multiple types, multiple bands
May 08 13:55:27 <RammsteinFan>	you could be the next tesla :)
May 08 13:55:43 <hoppy>	yagi-uda arrays, simple wires, also grid-pack type dish
May 08 13:56:10 <RammsteinFan>	erm i have no idea what those are
May 08 13:56:16 <hoppy>	you will hear me in Goa!
May 08 13:56:21 <RammsteinFan>	i just know yagi-uda 
May 08 13:56:24 <RammsteinFan>	wow really?
May 08 13:56:25 <RammsteinFan>	cool
May 08 13:56:32 <RammsteinFan>	i wont be in goa btw :)
May 08 13:56:42 <hoppy>	where then?
May 08 13:56:46 <RammsteinFan>	tell me when to tune in :)
May 08 13:56:53 <hoppy>	lol ok
May 08 13:57:11 <RammsteinFan>	its a small town about 150 kms from goa
May 08 13:57:16 <hoppy>	also I make big amplifier
May 08 13:57:22 <RammsteinFan>	scary!
May 08 13:57:33 <RammsteinFan>	dont scare me..i already scared
May 08 13:57:47 <hoppy>	nahh it's ok, I am legal
May 08 13:58:00 <RammsteinFan>	big amplifier to drive the antenna?
May 08 13:58:05 <hoppy>	yes
May 08 13:58:10 <RammsteinFan>	aaah
May 08 13:58:22 <hoppy>	I is power-mad
May 08 13:58:26 <RammsteinFan>	lol
May 08 13:58:36 <RammsteinFan>	you are scaring me again
May 08 13:58:52 <hoppy>	heyy relax, I is harmless
May 08 13:58:57 <RammsteinFan>	:)
May 08 13:59:26 <RammsteinFan>	can i really hear you in goa?
May 08 14:00:02 <hoppy>	using some digital modes, yes, in some conditions... sometimes with voice too
May 08 14:00:23 <RammsteinFan>	so you will be using AM right?
May 08 14:00:45 <hoppy>	no, AM is what they used in noah's Ark
May 08 14:00:50 <RammsteinFan>	ya nut
May 08 14:01:09 <RammsteinFan>	you are great at making things up
May 08 14:01:14 <hoppy>	I will use WSPR, JT65, or SSB
May 08 14:01:27 <RammsteinFan>	SSB is for short range
May 08 14:01:32 <hoppy>	wrong
May 08 14:01:36 <RammsteinFan>	like walkie-talkie
May 08 14:01:55 <hoppy>	SSB can go anywhere, even over EME path
May 08 14:02:00 <RammsteinFan>	ok
May 08 14:02:09 <RammsteinFan>	once you build it i wil tune in
May 08 14:02:11 <hoppy>	EME=Earth-Moon-Earth
May 08 14:02:16 <RammsteinFan>	any idea when it will be?
May 08 14:02:29 <RammsteinFan>	yeah i was on the moon once
May 08 14:02:33 <RammsteinFan>	we used coconut phones
May 08 14:03:14 <hoppy>	tomorrow I can put up wire antenna, and try WSPR mode
May 08 14:03:41 <hoppy>	previously have got all over globe using WSPR mode
May 08 14:03:48 <RammsteinFan>	and how do i tune in? using normal radio?
May 08 14:04:40 <hoppy>	no, it must be HF radio with interface to computer, and it is digital mode so you will not hear me
May 08 14:05:11 <RammsteinFan>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(AM)
May 08 14:05:39 <hoppy>	wait, laptop is slowwwwwwwwwwwww
May 08 14:06:00 <RammsteinFan>	okkkkkkkkkkk
May 08 14:06:29 <hoppy>	try https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)
May 08 14:07:36 <hoppy>	I can tell you think I is dreaming
May 08 14:08:26 <RammsteinFan>	good to know you arent
May 08 14:09:04 <hoppy>	I have heard EME signal here but not tried to transmit
May 08 14:09:34 <RammsteinFan>	how could you hear eme signal? there is no one on the moon atm
May 08 14:10:05 <RammsteinFan>	ok let me check on wiki
May 08 14:10:14 <hoppy>	big murican station send signal to man in moon, it bounce off and come back here
May 08 14:10:39 <hoppy>	it go a very long distance
May 08 14:11:12 <RammsteinFan>	why send the signal all the way to the moon? wouldnt it be easier to just it across earth directly?
May 08 14:11:14 <hoppy>	therefore called 'moonbounce' by some people
May 08 14:11:22 <RammsteinFan>	yes i am reading aobut it
May 08 14:12:15 <hoppy>	yes, direct might be easier, but higher frequencies only generally travel in straight lines
May 08 14:13:20 <hoppy>	for example, 10 GHZ eme is possible, but using a terrestrial path between here and Goa would be impossible
May 08 14:14:07 <RammsteinFan>	i see
May 08 14:14:25 <RammsteinFan>	but in that case why not settle on a lower frequency?
May 08 14:14:39 <RammsteinFan>	btw i ask a lot of questions :)
May 08 14:14:47 <hoppy>	because eme is a technical challenge
May 08 14:15:04 <hoppy>	and I will be hero
May 08 14:15:07 <RammsteinFan>	ah so its just coz you want to do it
May 08 14:15:15 <RammsteinFan>	sure you will be
May 08 14:15:22 <hoppy>	yes, that is about right :-)
May 08 14:15:27 <RammsteinFan>	:)
May 08 14:15:31 <RammsteinFan>	i got it now
May 08 14:15:59 <RammsteinFan>	i once built a robot who followed light
May 08 14:16:08 <hoppy>	10 gHz is too hard, I will try much lower
May 08 14:16:21 <RammsteinFan>	not much practical use but i did it just coz i wanted to
May 08 14:16:23 <hoppy>	ahhh robots are cool
May 08 14:16:46 <hoppy>	our Prime Minister is robot
May 08 14:16:49 <RammsteinFan>	is that why you were building the PLL?
May 08 14:16:52 <RammsteinFan>	lol
May 08 14:16:58 <RammsteinFan>	so was our previous one
May 08 14:17:27 <RammsteinFan>	i want to try lunar ranging
May 08 14:17:31 <hoppy>	PLL is for signal source for 2.4 Ghz transmitter
May 08 14:17:38 <RammsteinFan>	that would be pretty cool
May 08 14:17:53 <RammsteinFan>	yes so are you goin to use that PLL for EME?
May 08 14:18:16 <hoppy>	eventually, I may do that
May 08 14:18:34 <RammsteinFan>	ok
May 08 14:19:21 <hoppy>	you have reminded me to get the PLL working
May 08 14:19:51 <RammsteinFan>	:)
May 08 14:20:17 <hoppy>	it need connector for 10MHz source
May 08 14:20:47 <RammsteinFan>	and its not available?
May 08 14:21:02 <hoppy>	I just need to get from epay
May 08 14:21:10 <RammsteinFan>	ah

May 29 16:21:17 <hoppy>	I remember, we were talking about digital modes on HF radio
May 29 16:21:25 <RammsteinFan>	yeah we were
May 29 16:21:45 <RammsteinFan>	are you still working on that?
May 29 16:21:46 <hoppy>	yes, it's quite feasible to decode a signal from here in india
May 29 16:22:09 <RammsteinFan>	i guess i could decode but dont know how to...
May 29 16:22:16 <RammsteinFan>	im no expert like you with radios
May 29 16:22:55 <RammsteinFan>	lol you are typing in the wrong window hops
May 29 16:23:10 <hoppy>	lol that will confuse them
May 29 16:23:17 <RammsteinFan>	lol indeed
May 29 16:24:39 <RammsteinFan>	so can i buy a radio off the shelf and get what you are transmitting?
May 29 16:24:40 <hoppy>	once i put up simple wire antenna and let WSPR transmitter run, got about 20 decodes from all over the world
May 29 16:24:53 <RammsteinFan>	ah 
May 29 16:24:55 <RammsteinFan>	cool
May 29 16:25:04 <hoppy>	you could do that, yes
May 29 16:25:18 <RammsteinFan>	20 decodes meaning 20 radio stations? or were they transmitting something else?
May 29 16:26:20 <hoppy>	no, with wspr, stations that receive me send the information to a web site, so I can see that I have been heard
May 29 16:27:07 <RammsteinFan>	i see
May 29 16:27:27 <RammsteinFan>	let me check up wspr
May 29 16:27:46 <hoppy>	easiest way to try it would be to get a license and buy or build a very basic transmitter
