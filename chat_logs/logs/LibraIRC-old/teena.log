Jan 25 06:38:56 <teena>	that tells me that you know how to cook, you need some instruction, that's all

Jan 25 06:41:32 <RammsteinFan>	im an atheist
Jan 25 06:41:32 <teena>	and he doesn't understand a lot of the concepts I suggest...
Jan 25 06:41:43 <teena>	i think that's why i understand you.  lol
Jan 25 06:41:46 <RammsteinFan>	:)
Jan 25 06:41:52 <RammsteinFan>	so you are an atheist too?
Jan 25 06:42:24 <RammsteinFan>	he is a bit stubborn
Jan 25 06:42:25 <teena>	Well, I normally say I'm agnostic....i feel that i'm in no position to definitively say there is no god.
Jan 25 06:42:43 <RammsteinFan>	well you can take my word for it then :D
Jan 25 06:42:47 <teena>	lol...
Jan 25 06:42:49 <RammsteinFan>	there is no god :)
Jan 25 06:42:54 <teena>	the difference is very slim...
Jan 25 06:42:57 <RammsteinFan>	i now
Jan 25 06:42:59 <RammsteinFan>	know*
Jan 25 06:43:05 <RammsteinFan>	i was an agnostic earlier
Jan 25 06:43:16 <teena>	I have met many indian men here..
Jan 25 06:43:16 <RammsteinFan>	now i am pretty much sure there isnt a god
Jan 25 06:43:27 <teena>	many are a bit chauvinistic
Jan 25 06:43:32 <RammsteinFan>	they are asses
Jan 25 06:43:37 <RammsteinFan>	the lot of em
Jan 25 06:43:47 <teena>	they like to be overly sexual...
Jan 25 06:43:49 <RammsteinFan>	make the rest of us look bad
Jan 25 06:43:55 <RammsteinFan>	lol i know
Jan 25 06:44:08 <RammsteinFan>	i was on a chat site once and no one talked to me for a month
Jan 25 06:44:10 <teena>	there's nothing wrong with that, of course...but I like to get to know someone before I start talking about that
Jan 25 06:44:15 <RammsteinFan>	exactly
Jan 25 06:44:18 <RammsteinFan>	i know that
Jan 25 06:44:27 <RammsteinFan>	its coz most of them are sexually repressed
Jan 25 06:44:32 <teena>	yeah...
Jan 25 06:44:36 <RammsteinFan>	frustrated beyond belief
Jan 25 06:44:43 <RammsteinFan>	our soceity is like that
Jan 25 06:44:44 <teena>	many only have one partner...which I can't imagine
Jan 25 06:44:46 <RammsteinFan>	not their fault
Jan 25 06:44:47 <teena>	yeah....
Jan 25 06:44:49 <teena>	i kjnow
Jan 25 06:44:50 <teena>	know
Jan 25 06:45:01 <RammsteinFan>	which is bullshit
Jan 25 06:45:07 <RammsteinFan>	its just like hunger
Jan 25 06:45:10 <RammsteinFan>	i dont get it
Jan 25 06:45:20 <teena>	yes, you're absolutely right...
Jan 25 06:45:23 <RammsteinFan>	what wrong with sex?
Jan 25 06:45:26 <teena>	it's a need that must be fulfilled.
Jan 25 06:45:29 <teena>	nothing.....
Jan 25 06:45:44 <RammsteinFan>	i cant even talk about it with a lot of my frinds...they get uncomfortable
Jan 25 06:45:45 <RammsteinFan>	loool
Jan 25 06:45:47 <teena>	....but religion plays a part in it, I think...
Jan 25 06:45:53 <RammsteinFan>	whih makes me do it more ahahahah
Jan 25 06:46:02 <RammsteinFan>	i dont think religion plays a part in it
Jan 25 06:46:16 <teena>	but the problem with that....when you feel uncomfortable, you can't talk about it then you never LEARN anything about it
Jan 25 06:46:18 <RammsteinFan>	its more like what society will think of you if this gets out in the open
Jan 25 06:46:27 <RammsteinFan>	yes exactly
Jan 25 06:46:36 <RammsteinFan>	i just want to get it out in the open
Jan 25 06:46:41 <RammsteinFan>	make them see the point
Jan 25 06:46:44 <RammsteinFan>	none of them do
Jan 25 06:46:54 <RammsteinFan>	its like being in an intellectual prison
Jan 25 06:47:03 <teena>	it's difficult to be comfortable with it if you haven't experienced it
Jan 25 06:47:14 <RammsteinFan>	maybe
Jan 25 06:47:15 <teena>	ah, i know what you mean
Jan 25 06:47:19 <RammsteinFan>	times are changing though
Jan 25 06:47:21 <teena>	i like discussing it, too
Jan 25 06:47:37 <RammsteinFan>	the younger crop are a whole lot diff than our generation
Jan 25 06:47:39 <teena>	my coworker told me that--he said the bigger cities are becoming much more liberal
Jan 25 06:47:44 <RammsteinFan>	yes 
Jan 25 06:47:52 <RammsteinFan>	punjabi guy?
Jan 25 06:47:57 <teena>	yes...lol

Jan 25 06:48:58 <RammsteinFan>	ive see you play
Jan 25 06:49:07 <RammsteinFan>	no i can discuss it with anyone
Jan 25 06:49:17 <teena>	i'm glad to hear that
Jan 25 06:49:31 <teena>	....what do you like to discuss?  I'm curious...
Jan 25 06:49:31 <RammsteinFan>	talking doesnt make me uncomfortable at all
Jan 25 06:49:34 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jan 25 06:49:38 <RammsteinFan>	really?
Jan 25 06:49:39 <teena>	me neither
Jan 25 06:49:53 <teena>	i'm not trying to get into a sexy convo with you---but i'm curious ..
Jan 25 06:50:04 <RammsteinFan>	ah ok
Jan 25 06:50:18 <RammsteinFan>	well i like to know what kind of positions they like
Jan 25 06:50:24 <teena>	ahhh, i see...
Jan 25 06:50:28 <RammsteinFan>	how to get a girl into bed
Jan 25 06:50:37 <RammsteinFan>	those sorts of things
Jan 25 06:50:46 <teena>	i know how to get a girl into bed.  LOL
Jan 25 06:50:49 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jan 25 06:50:52 *	teena is a girl
Jan 25 06:51:01 <RammsteinFan>	i got ti
Jan 25 06:51:03 <RammsteinFan>	it*
Jan 25 06:51:10 <RammsteinFan>	i went out a lot in japan
Jan 25 06:51:16 <teena>	....i once had a rather naughty chat with an indian guy
Jan 25 06:51:18 <RammsteinFan>	in india its different
Jan 25 06:51:24 <teena>	and he was lost....he didn't KNOW anything
Jan 25 06:51:24 <RammsteinFan>	ah
Jan 25 06:51:37 <teena>	he WANTED it..but had no clue what to do
Jan 25 06:51:51 <RammsteinFan>	if he is unmarried and born in the 80s then chances are he is inexpereinced
Jan 25 06:51:59 <RammsteinFan>	chat like online?
Jan 25 06:52:03 <teena>	yep
Jan 25 06:52:06 <RammsteinFan>	ok
Jan 25 06:52:17 <RammsteinFan>	cybersex is kinda lame imo
Jan 25 06:52:38 <RammsteinFan>	dont you think?
Jan 25 06:52:39 <teena>	meh---it can be interesting....
Jan 25 06:52:46 <RammsteinFan>	its just words
Jan 25 06:52:48 <RammsteinFan>	bleh
Jan 25 06:52:56 <RammsteinFan>	not as intersting as the actual thing
Jan 25 06:52:59 <teena>	yes, but ....if you have nothing else?
Jan 25 06:53:07 <RammsteinFan>	well yes
Jan 25 06:53:08 <teena>	of course the REAL thing is the best!
Jan 25 06:53:28 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jan 25 06:53:29 <RammsteinFan>	exactly
Jan 25 06:53:31 <teena>	but cybersex is like any other aspect of sex:  some people like it, others don't
Jan 25 06:53:39 <RammsteinFan>	ah good point
Jan 25 06:53:59 <RammsteinFan>	hadnt really thought about it that way
Jan 25 06:54:06 <teena>	i think two people who like it  can really be fulfilled
Jan 25 06:54:18 <RammsteinFan>	ummm maybe
Jan 25 06:54:28 <RammsteinFan>	not my thing though
Jan 25 06:54:33 <RammsteinFan>	i prefer the real stuff :D
Jan 25 06:54:38 <RammsteinFan>	call me old fashioned loool
Jan 25 06:54:38 <teena>	....i know that if you REALLY want the real thing....that's all you'll settle for
Jan 25 06:54:57 <teena>	I don't get enough of the real stuff...I have to supplement my "diet"
Jan 25 06:55:05 <RammsteinFan>	ah i see
Jan 25 06:55:19 <teena>	besides...
Jan 25 06:55:20 <RammsteinFan>	being married kinda sucks eh?
Jan 25 06:55:27 <teena>	....no
Jan 25 06:55:36 <RammsteinFan>	besides what?
Jan 25 06:55:44 <teena>	being married is fine...except you are held hostage by the sex drive of your spouse
Jan 25 06:55:53 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jan 25 06:55:56 <RammsteinFan>	i wouldnt know abut that
Jan 25 06:56:07 <teena>	i was going to say
Jan 25 06:56:15 <RammsteinFan>	yes?
Jan 25 06:56:27 <teena>	it takes a lot of effort to start a physical relationship with another person...
Jan 25 06:56:34 <RammsteinFan>	no it doenst
Jan 25 06:56:40 <RammsteinFan>	maybe in north america
Jan 25 06:56:47 <teena>	it's easy for a woman because most men are always happy to oblige....but....much more difficult for a man
Jan 25 06:56:51 <RammsteinFan>	japan was better in that aspect
Jan 25 06:57:03 <teena>	i imagine Japan would be the same as n. america
Jan 25 06:57:16 <RammsteinFan>	as long as the woman isnt looking for any commitment its fine
Jan 25 06:57:24 <RammsteinFan>	well they are very open about sex
Jan 25 06:57:31 <teena>	judging by your confidence level...i think you had a lot of flings in Japan. LOL
Jan 25 06:57:35 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jan 25 06:57:45 <RammsteinFan>	im not getting into that
Jan 25 06:57:51 <teena>	well, i know.
Jan 25 06:57:57 <teena>	you don't have to say yes.
Jan 25 06:58:01 <RammsteinFan>	but yes ive been around the block :D
Jan 25 06:58:06 <teena>	i can tell
Jan 25 06:58:11 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jan 25 06:58:14 <RammsteinFan>	really?
Jan 25 06:58:18 <RammsteinFan>	how ?
Jan 25 06:58:23 <RammsteinFan>	im curious lol
Jan 25 06:58:29 <teena>	that's probably why you don't come off as a typical indian
Jan 25 06:58:34 <RammsteinFan>	aaaah i see
Jan 25 06:58:40 <teena>	...you can talk about sex intellectually
Jan 25 06:58:49 <RammsteinFan>	right!

Jan 25 07:03:06 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jan 25 07:03:09 <teena>	i know women who want men with extra large penises....
Jan 25 07:03:13 <RammsteinFan>	ah yes
Jan 25 07:03:17 <teena>	they don't CARE if they're as stupid as rocks...
Jan 25 07:03:20 <RammsteinFan>	i know that
Jan 25 07:03:33 <teena>	I'd rather someone who has an opinion, a brain...lol
Jan 25 07:03:36 <RammsteinFan>	i dont like such women

Jan 25 07:03:49 <RammsteinFan>	yes i know
Jan 25 07:04:14 <RammsteinFan>	meeting of the minds is important too
Jan 25 07:04:27 <teena>	i don't have physical beauty, but...I know that the men i've known find me intelligent
Jan 25 07:04:33 <RammsteinFan>	or you might as well be going though the motions
Jan 25 07:04:40 <teena>	except when I can't spell INTELLIGENT.

Jan 25 07:07:32 <RammsteinFan>	and?
Jan 25 07:07:45 <teena>	do you remember a chatter called Optimus Prime?
Jan 25 07:07:52 <RammsteinFan>	ive seen the name yes
Jan 25 07:08:01 <teena>	not here--that's just his bot
Jan 25 07:08:05 <RammsteinFan>	ah ok

Jan 25 07:08:18 <RammsteinFan>	sure
Jan 25 07:08:19 <teena>	he was like you--smart....
Jan 25 07:08:29 <RammsteinFan>	but?
Jan 25 07:08:30 <teena>	but....very much entrenched in Indian culture
Jan 25 07:08:32 *	RammsteinFan smiles
Jan 25 07:08:36 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jan 25 07:08:39 <teena>	had a wife...

Jan 25 07:08:40 <RammsteinFan>	i knew this was coming
Jan 25 07:08:52 <teena>	but still wanted to talk about sex with me...
Jan 25 07:08:58 <teena>	i knew where that was going...
Jan 25 07:09:05 <RammsteinFan>	sure
Jan 25 07:09:09 <teena>	i told him--take care of your wife...and your kid!
Jan 25 07:09:16 <RammsteinFan>	maybe didnt get enough from his wife
Jan 25 07:09:26 <RammsteinFan>	oh i know a lot of men like that
Jan 25 07:09:42 <teena>	he didn't....but...i felt terrible that this poor girl was taking care of a baby while he played around online
Jan 25 07:09:43 <RammsteinFan>	how old was he?
Jan 25 07:09:52 <teena>	hmmm...
Jan 25 07:09:53 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jan 25 07:09:56 <teena>	around your age
Jan 25 07:09:57 <RammsteinFan>	this isnt nice
Jan 25 07:10:06 <RammsteinFan>	yep
Jan 25 07:10:11 <RammsteinFan>	must be like a jackrabbit
Jan 25 07:10:16 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jan 25 07:10:16 <teena>	2 or 3 years ago, he was 29..so yeah, your age..
Jan 25 07:10:25 <teena>	why do you say that?
Jan 25 07:10:41 <RammsteinFan>	coz he wanted to fool around even when he had a wife
Jan 25 07:11:02 <RammsteinFan>	thats the reason i dont fall for married women
Jan 25 07:11:02 <teena>	....men are programmed to want sex, all the time, wife or no wife
Jan 25 07:11:13 <RammsteinFan>	what happens when their spouse finds out?
Jan 25 07:11:19 <teena>	well, i can think of many reasons NOT to fall for married women...
Jan 25 07:11:24 <RammsteinFan>	well its evolutionary
Jan 25 07:11:33 <teena>	some don't care.
Jan 25 07:11:38 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jan 25 07:11:40 <RammsteinFan>	i know
Jan 25 07:11:46 <teena>	my husband told me----find your fun somewhere else.
Jan 25 07:11:51 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jan 25 07:11:53 <RammsteinFan>	thats harsh
Jan 25 07:11:54 <teena>	yes..
Jan 25 07:11:56 <teena>	no
Jan 25 07:11:59 <teena>	it's really not
Jan 25 07:12:02 <RammsteinFan>	wtf did he marry you for?
Jan 25 07:12:06 <teena>	he loves being married to me.
Jan 25 07:12:17 <RammsteinFan>	im confused
Jan 25 07:12:17 <teena>	we get along, but he has very little desire due to illness
Jan 25 07:12:23 <RammsteinFan>	oh awww
Jan 25 07:12:27 <RammsteinFan>	sorry to hear that
Jan 25 07:12:41 <teena>	so, rather than ruin a good relationship, he just gives me permission to ...have fun :)
Jan 25 07:12:48 <teena>	he's not terminally ill
Jan 25 07:12:52 <RammsteinFan>	i can understand that
Jan 25 07:12:57 <RammsteinFan>	hes very open minded
Jan 25 07:13:02 <teena>	he had an illness that stopped his testosterone production
Jan 25 07:13:08 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jan 25 07:13:10 <RammsteinFan>	that sucks
Jan 25 07:13:11 <teena>	he takes injections now, but it didn't help his desire
Jan 25 07:13:20 <teena>	that's why i have no children...
Jan 25 07:13:26 <RammsteinFan>	:(
Jan 25 07:13:33 <RammsteinFan>	so sorry to hear that
Jan 25 07:13:39 <teena>	i'm a very happy person--don't be sorry
Jan 25 07:13:45 <teena>	i'm happy for what i have...
Jan 25 07:13:49 <RammsteinFan>	that you are! :)
Jan 25 07:13:56 <RammsteinFan>	and always be like that :)
Jan 25 07:14:13 <teena>	I don't intend to change...hehe
Jan 25 07:14:17 <RammsteinFan>	good :)
Jan 25 07:14:34 <teena>	so, as you can see....everyone has a story...everyone has a reason for what they do
Jan 25 07:14:40 <RammsteinFan>	yes i know
Jan 25 07:14:50 <teena>	i feel that i'm a good wife...
Jan 25 07:14:51 <RammsteinFan>	that is exactly hwy i dont judge people
Jan 25 07:15:04 <RammsteinFan>	coz i dont know what they are going through
Jan 25 07:15:21 <RammsteinFan>	im a bit impulsive 
Jan 25 07:15:21 <teena>	.....yes...it's terrible to have very little intimacy in marriage.
Jan 25 07:15:32 <RammsteinFan>	so i may say some things whcih may come across as harsh
Jan 25 07:15:43 <RammsteinFan>	i can only imagine
Jan 25 07:15:50 <teena>	sometimes I'm the same way--i'm learning to temper my thoughts
Jan 25 07:16:09 <RammsteinFan>	but i like ot believe i am a good person at heart
Jan 25 07:16:18 <teena>	i think you are, too
Jan 25 07:16:25 <RammsteinFan>	i dont screw people over to get what i want
Jan 25 07:16:34 <teena>	i've observed you being harsh...but i've observed you being very compassionate
Jan 25 07:16:37 <RammsteinFan>	that i think is a very good quality these days
Jan 25 07:16:51 <teena>	i know.  You seem genuine
Jan 25 07:16:58 <RammsteinFan>	oh when have i been harsh? 
Jan 25 07:17:00 <RammsteinFan>	to you?
Jan 25 07:17:16 <RammsteinFan>	i AM genuine
Jan 25 07:17:20 <teena>	sometimes in chat--you can be harsh.  Not necessarily to me--maye to others
Jan 25 07:17:23 <RammsteinFan>	i dont like to pretend to be someone else
Jan 25 07:17:25 <teena>	maybe
Jan 25 07:17:29 <teena>	neither do i.
Jan 25 07:17:36 <RammsteinFan>	i dont think i have been like that
Jan 25 07:17:42 <teena>	i'm the same person here as I am offline
Jan 25 07:17:45 <RammsteinFan>	only to people who deserve it
Jan 25 07:17:51 <RammsteinFan>	yeah me too
Jan 25 07:17:58 <teena>	well, ok---if they deserve it...then it's fair
