Jul 02 10:48:26 <teena>	you can say "no".  LOL
Jul 02 10:48:32 <teena>	ahhh, ok...good
Jul 02 10:48:42 <teena>	so you passed all your exams?
Jul 02 10:48:49 <RammsteinFan>	it was just one exam..

Jul 02 10:50:08 <RammsteinFan>	i did well
Jul 02 10:50:15 <RammsteinFan>	but not as well as i hoped to do
Jul 02 10:50:21 <RammsteinFan>	i just had one month to prepare
Jul 02 10:50:31 <teena>	that's usually how it does....you're not alone
Jul 02 10:50:38 <teena>	does-goes
Jul 02 10:50:45 <RammsteinFan>	i guess
Jul 02 10:51:00 <teena>	how is living with your parents doing?  Are you getting annoyed yet?
Jul 02 10:51:13 <RammsteinFan>	why would i be annoyed living with my parents?
Jul 02 10:51:22 <RammsteinFan>	thats a strange question to ask
Jul 02 10:51:30 <teena>	well, sometimes adult children get annoyed when they go back and live with family
Jul 02 10:51:39 <teena>	Not really--it's cultural
Jul 02 10:51:49 <RammsteinFan>	maybe in your culture...not in mine
Jul 02 10:51:53 <teena>	I lived with my parents until I was 34
Jul 02 10:52:01 <teena>	but I'm not sure if I could go back and live with them now
Jul 02 10:52:04 <RammsteinFan>	here we believe in live and let live...we dont just think about ourself
Jul 02 10:52:19 <RammsteinFan>	all i care about is me and FTW
Jul 02 10:52:31 <RammsteinFan>	thats not part of my culture and i am very proud to szy that
Jul 02 10:52:32 <teena>	hey--i dont' disagree.  I take care of my parents.  I see them several times a week...call every day.  I'm always there to help them....
Jul 02 10:52:41 <RammsteinFan>	i know
Jul 02 10:52:55 <teena>	I'm glad you feel that way---it's a great way to be.
Jul 02 10:53:13 <RammsteinFan>	but diff cultures seem to be strange to the other cultures...just telling you how it is here
Jul 02 10:53:16 <teena>	I don't agree when kids desert their parents in old age (it happens here a lot)
Jul 02 10:53:25 <RammsteinFan>	yeah those kids are the worst
Jul 02 10:53:28 <teena>	i know ....
Jul 02 10:53:37 <teena>	i wasn't raised that way
Jul 02 10:53:43 <RammsteinFan>	good
Jul 02 10:53:56 <teena>	that's what's nice about Canada...we retain the cultures of our parents....
Jul 02 10:54:04 <RammsteinFan>	good

Jul 02 11:26:04 <teena>	I'd rather be outside than anything else.

Jul 02 11:27:59 <teena>	oh, thank you!
Jul 02 11:28:04 <teena>	I'm glad you feel that way
Jul 02 11:28:04 <RammsteinFan>	can i ask you a question? 
Jul 02 11:28:07 <teena>	yes!
Jul 02 11:28:08 <teena>	always!
Jul 02 11:28:32 <RammsteinFan>	i hope you are not offended but why do you keep singing in main?
Jul 02 11:28:45 <teena>	because it makes me happy?
Jul 02 11:28:55 <RammsteinFan>	the lyrics are quite "entertaining" 
Jul 02 11:29:00 <RammsteinFan>	:)
Jul 02 11:29:02 <teena>	what do you mean?
Jul 02 11:29:07 <RammsteinFan>	oh yeah i got no problem with singing
Jul 02 11:29:19 <RammsteinFan>	its just sometimes the lyrics are a bit risque
Jul 02 11:29:34 <teena>	well, you know me....i'm very liberal about sexual things
Jul 02 11:29:45 <teena>	i was brought up that way
Jul 02 11:29:48 <teena>	honestly
Jul 02 11:29:57 <RammsteinFan>	yeah but singing it in main can give different ideas to someone who doesnt know you
Jul 02 11:30:14 <teena>	but a person has the obligation to get to know me.
Jul 02 11:30:26 <RammsteinFan>	singing isnt bad at all...im just wondering why those kind of songs
Jul 02 11:30:28 <teena>	Judging me because i repeat song lyrics that i enjoy is unfair
Jul 02 11:30:34 <RammsteinFan>	anyway it doesnt matter
Jul 02 11:30:46 <teena>	i value my sexuality
Jul 02 11:30:52 <RammsteinFan>	no one is judging you...im just saying people are like that 
Jul 02 11:30:55 <teena>	i feel as if I'm getting older....
Jul 02 11:31:00 <teena>	i know how people are
Jul 02 11:31:09 <RammsteinFan>	so someone who has just joined can get a very different idea
Jul 02 11:31:11 <teena>	i guess i don't care.  I know who I am
Jul 02 11:31:17 <RammsteinFan>	ofcourse 
Jul 02 11:31:20 <teena>	yes, but i want to be me....
Jul 02 11:31:34 <RammsteinFan>	sure
Jul 02 11:31:42 <teena>	if I have to worry about what newcomers think of me, then i'm living my life for them instead of me
Jul 02 11:31:51 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jul 02 11:31:55 <RammsteinFan>	i agree
Jul 02 11:31:59 <teena>	ram...
Jul 02 11:32:05 <teena>	you'll learn when you get married
Jul 02 11:32:06 <RammsteinFan>	you might get a lot of pvt messages then lol
Jul 02 11:32:14 <teena>	no, i never get pvt messages....
Jul 02 11:32:28 <RammsteinFan>	ah 
Jul 02 11:32:33 <RammsteinFan>	then its fine i guess
Jul 02 11:32:34 <teena>	if your wife doesn't show you any affection or appreciation.....
Jul 02 11:32:46 <RammsteinFan>	hmmm
Jul 02 11:32:48 <teena>	you'll look for it anywhere
Jul 02 11:32:52 <RammsteinFan>	but she will...ill make sure of that
Jul 02 11:32:56 <RammsteinFan>	heheeh
Jul 02 11:32:56 <teena>	and for me, if I'm happy, I love to sing
Jul 02 11:33:05 <RammsteinFan>	i understand
Jul 02 11:33:10 <teena>	you can't force someone to love you......
Jul 02 11:33:18 <teena>	even someone who loved you in the past
Jul 02 11:33:20 <RammsteinFan>	so open adverstising is the way to do it?
Jul 02 11:33:28 <teena>	it's not advertising...
Jul 02 11:33:33 <teena>	i'm not looking for someone new
Jul 02 11:33:40 <teena>	when i feel happy i just sing....
Jul 02 11:33:47 <teena>	i don't pay attention to what others thing
Jul 02 11:33:49 <teena>	think
Jul 02 11:34:02 <teena>	when i'm doing yardwork...i sing
Jul 02 11:34:05 <RammsteinFan>	sure
Jul 02 11:34:07 <teena>	when i do housework, I sing
Jul 02 11:34:29 <teena>	....i just always listen to music and derive all the happiness I can
Jul 02 11:34:40 <RammsteinFan>	the love fades away after sometime but you can still try to keep it alive
Jul 02 11:34:58 <teena>	when a person doesn't feel desired, songs can make you feel like you have "something" you really dont'
Jul 02 11:34:59 <RammsteinFan>	ive seen some of my friends who had love marriages turn into that
Jul 02 11:35:06 <teena>	yeah
Jul 02 11:35:11 <RammsteinFan>	and within a few years too
Jul 02 11:35:23 <teena>	and even if you find someone else...that person owes you nothing
Jul 02 11:35:32 <RammsteinFan>	sure i understand...and so i say carry one singing
Jul 02 11:35:47 <teena>	in fact, you put yourself in a position where you can get hurt really easily
Jul 02 11:35:53 <RammsteinFan>	relationships shoulndt be about owing and not owing
Jul 02 11:35:53 <teena>	so I sing to keep myself happy.....
Jul 02 11:35:59 <teena>	i know that
Jul 02 11:36:03 <teena>	i'm not possessive....
Jul 02 11:36:11 <RammsteinFan>	ok
Jul 02 11:36:35 <teena>	i'm not singing to anyone in particular....
Jul 02 11:36:42 <teena>	i'm singing to myself....
Jul 02 11:37:03 <RammsteinFan>	people need to understand that if that person is not interested then he wont be interested whatever you do
Jul 02 11:37:04 <teena>	reminding myself that in this world of billions, there may be someone out there who appreciates me....
Jul 02 11:37:16 <teena>	hehe, trust me, I know that
Jul 02 11:37:33 <RammsteinFan>	sure you just need to look harder and further
Jul 02 11:37:40 <teena>	i've never been honest and open with you about what I deal with
Jul 02 11:37:55 <RammsteinFan>	what do you deal with?
Jul 02 11:38:02 <teena>	well.....
Jul 02 11:38:10 <teena>	do you want to hear it?
Jul 02 11:38:19 <RammsteinFan>	if you want me to listen i will
Jul 02 11:38:26 <teena>	well....
Jul 02 11:38:33 <RammsteinFan>	i dont mind but do you really want to tell me?
Jul 02 11:38:40 <teena>	you know i was married to a gay man...and I divorced him
Jul 02 11:38:47 <RammsteinFan>	oh
Jul 02 11:38:53 <teena>	then i felt it was important to be married again because I LIKE being a wife
Jul 02 11:38:58 <RammsteinFan>	you didnt know he was gay befoer you married him?
Jul 02 11:39:15 <RammsteinFan>	sure i can understand that
Jul 02 11:39:20 <teena>	no, we didn't have sex together, so I had no clue. I was very religious and I didn't want to "sin"
Jul 02 11:39:29 <RammsteinFan>	ah ok
Jul 02 11:39:41 <RammsteinFan>	sure
Jul 02 11:39:45 <teena>	so, we were together for nearly 9 years and divorced
Jul 02 11:39:49 <teena>	i met my second husband
Jul 02 11:40:05 <RammsteinFan>	ok
Jul 02 11:40:21 <teena>	he put many rules on me.  He said if one of us was unable to satisfy the other sexually due to sickness etc, we could outside the marriage, etc....as you know
Jul 02 11:40:27 <teena>	i was okay with that
Jul 02 11:40:32 <RammsteinFan>	sure 
Jul 02 11:40:36 <teena>	so, i am a very good wife.....
Jul 02 11:40:41 <RammsteinFan>	thats being very open minded
Jul 02 11:40:46 <teena>	am i willing to let him go outside the marriage, unfortunately
Jul 02 11:41:04 <teena>	he feels that i should be happy with what he offers to me, which is sex when HE wants it.
Jul 02 11:41:14 <teena>	so if I'm interested.....
Jul 02 11:41:17 <teena>	i'm out of luck
Jul 02 11:41:31 <RammsteinFan>	ah i see
Jul 02 11:41:33 <teena>	i try to stay happy by singing.....
Jul 02 11:41:38 <teena>	and being a good wife....
Jul 02 11:41:50 <RammsteinFan>	but you are free to be with other guys outside marriage right?
Jul 02 11:41:52 <teena>	i do everything I can to make him happy so he appreciates me
Jul 02 11:42:04 <teena>	we are, but i really haven't done that, yet.
Jul 02 11:42:12 <RammsteinFan>	ah i see
Jul 02 11:42:15 <teena>	and technically, I am always willing to have sex with him
Jul 02 11:42:34 <teena>	i don't want to be with other men....
Jul 02 11:42:38 <teena>	that's the truth of it
Jul 02 11:42:38 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jul 02 11:42:50 <RammsteinFan>	but cybering is fine?
Jul 02 11:42:51 <teena>	but....i feel like my life is wasting away
Jul 02 11:42:58 <RammsteinFan>	sure i can understand that
Jul 02 11:42:58 <teena>	yeah...sometimes that's necessary
Jul 02 11:43:09 <RammsteinFan>	then why are you with him still?
Jul 02 11:43:16 <teena>	once a week isn't enough for me---would that be enough for you?
Jul 02 11:43:16 <RammsteinFan>	leave him and find another person
Jul 02 11:43:21 <RammsteinFan>	no way!
Jul 02 11:43:28 <RammsteinFan>	i want it everyday
Jul 02 11:43:45 <teena>	i can't be divorced twice.....and he's a good man in every other way....except, hardly any sex and he never compliments me
Jul 02 11:44:03 <teena>	my cooking is really good---everyone else says so
Jul 02 11:44:05 <RammsteinFan>	why dont you ask him why he never compliments you?
Jul 02 11:44:13 <RammsteinFan>	he did earlier?
Jul 02 11:44:15 <teena>	I did...
Jul 02 11:44:25 <teena>	he said that he isn't the type of person who gives compliments
Jul 02 11:44:30 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jul 02 11:44:30 <teena>	but he compliments women online.....
Jul 02 11:44:35 <teena>	on instagram.....
Jul 02 11:44:42 <RammsteinFan>	hes an ass then
Jul 02 11:44:49 <RammsteinFan>	pardon me but that is what he is
Jul 02 11:44:51 <teena>	he tells them they have nice bodies, etc
Jul 02 11:44:55 <teena>	i know...
Jul 02 11:45:00 <teena>	my sister said the same
Jul 02 11:45:07 <RammsteinFan>	she is right
Jul 02 11:45:16 <teena>	i make every meal for him
Jul 02 11:45:18 <RammsteinFan>	did you ask him about it?
Jul 02 11:45:28 <teena>	yes, he said it doesn't matter because it's online
Jul 02 11:45:34 <teena>	but..it's still a compliment
Jul 02 11:45:40 <teena>	why can't he say that to me?
Jul 02 11:45:40 <RammsteinFan>	it is
Jul 02 11:45:49 <RammsteinFan>	can i give you a suggestion?
Jul 02 11:45:56 <teena>	yes, please!
Jul 02 11:46:47 <RammsteinFan>	when you gives someone compliments online cook something for him and make it very spicy...and tell him you found the recipe online...on instagram
Jul 02 11:47:16 <RammsteinFan>	lets see if he doesnt like to give compliments after that
Jul 02 11:47:28 <RammsteinFan>	:)
Jul 02 11:48:23 <RammsteinFan>	still there?
Jul 02 11:48:28 <teena>	yes
Jul 02 11:48:33 <RammsteinFan>	hmmm ok
Jul 02 11:48:35 <teena>	but i do make spicy food for him--he likes it
Jul 02 11:48:50 <RammsteinFan>	make it so spicy he cant handle it
Jul 02 11:49:04 <teena>	he knows i know abou the girls he compliments on instagram
Jul 02 11:49:05 <RammsteinFan>	you know there are some people who will always take advantage of your good nature
Jul 02 11:49:26 <teena>	he knows that  i know about them, too
Jul 02 11:49:34 <RammsteinFan>	yeah i now
Jul 02 11:49:37 <RammsteinFan>	know*
Jul 02 11:49:52 <RammsteinFan>	so tell him if he can compliment them he can compliment you
Jul 02 11:49:57 <teena>	at first....(for about 8 months) i didn't even follow what was happening..then my sister found all the compliments he was giving them
Jul 02 11:50:02 <teena>	all ver sexy girls---not like me
Jul 02 11:50:14 <RammsteinFan>	most men are like that
Jul 02 11:50:15 <teena>	girls who take photos in their underwear
Jul 02 11:50:20 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jul 02 11:50:21 <teena>	i know
Jul 02 11:50:30 <teena>	i undestand how men are
Jul 02 11:50:37 <teena>	i know they like looking at other women
Jul 02 11:50:50 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jul 02 11:50:58 <teena>	but must appreciate their wives---especially if their wives are good cooks....good in bed, etc.
Jul 02 11:51:05 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jul 02 11:51:10 <teena>	sigh...
Jul 02 11:51:14 <teena>	ram, can i be honest?
Jul 02 11:51:19 <RammsteinFan>	yes 
Jul 02 11:51:31 <teena>	my husband tells me which day we are to have sex.
Jul 02 11:51:37 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jul 02 11:51:40 <teena>	it doesn't matter if he's on holiday
Jul 02 11:51:46 <teena>	i have to be happy to do it that day....
Jul 02 11:51:57 <RammsteinFan>	hes an ass
Jul 02 11:51:59 <teena>	and most of the time, I am...but I wish it could be spontaneous sometimes
Jul 02 11:52:09 <RammsteinFan>	it shoudl be
Jul 02 11:52:13 <teena>	i wish i could just approach him sometimes
Jul 02 11:52:19 <RammsteinFan>	its not work 
Jul 02 11:52:22 <teena>	but when i do, he gets angry
Jul 02 11:52:35 <teena>	my father told me I have to be more sexy...lol
Jul 02 11:52:36 <RammsteinFan>	reject him when he wants it
Jul 02 11:52:41 <RammsteinFan>	lol
Jul 02 11:52:50 <RammsteinFan>	wow you discuss these things with yoru dad?
Jul 02 11:53:01 <teena>	if I reject him when he wants it, it hurts me because then he doesn't want it for another week
Jul 02 11:53:05 <RammsteinFan>	when he wants it tell him you are not in the mood
Jul 02 11:53:13 <teena>	oh yes, my parents have an open relationship with me
Jul 02 11:53:37 <teena>	i've tried that, but it leaves me sometimes going 2-3 weeks without anything
Jul 02 11:53:45 <RammsteinFan>	hmmm
Jul 02 11:53:49 <teena>	he also won't be near me if I'm menstruating...
Jul 02 11:53:57 <teena>	so....it could be 4 weeks!
Jul 02 11:54:07 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jul 02 11:54:11 <teena>	i take whatever i can get ...i can't be passive aggressive about it
Jul 02 11:54:31 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jul 02 11:54:33 <RammsteinFan>	i can understand
Jul 02 11:54:34 <teena>	he's been home for four days.
Jul 02 11:54:50 <teena>	ON Friday, he woke up and said "get up"---no sex today
Jul 02 11:55:02 <teena>	today, same thing...."get up"...no sex today
Jul 02 11:55:13 <RammsteinFan>	hmmm
Jul 02 11:55:20 <RammsteinFan>	i am out of ideas now
Jul 02 11:55:20 <teena>	tomorrow i'm not sure.....he goes to the gym in the morning...so, probably not again...
Jul 02 11:55:25 <teena>	i know, right?
Jul 02 11:55:30 <RammsteinFan>	yeah
Jul 02 11:55:38 <teena>	even my parents find it odd and they run out of suggestions
Jul 02 11:55:44 <teena>	i've really tried everything
Jul 02 11:55:48 <RammsteinFan>	does he meet women outside?
Jul 02 11:55:57 <teena>	i don't think so, but i'm probably wrong.
Jul 02 11:56:08 <teena>	He cheated on me before we married
Jul 02 11:56:21 <RammsteinFan>	it could be that he gets what he wants outside and doenst want it at home 
Jul 02 11:56:27 <RammsteinFan>	aww im sorry for you
Jul 02 11:56:29 <teena>	he sends me on vacation by myself, so I think that's maybe when he meets other women
Jul 02 11:56:47 <RammsteinFan>	what a douche
Jul 02 11:56:58 <teena>	he watches porn---he hides it but I know he does because I can find it on his computer
Jul 02 11:57:09 <RammsteinFan>	porn is ok i guess
Jul 02 11:57:10 <teena>	so maybe i'm not attractive to him
Jul 02 11:57:19 <RammsteinFan>	it could be
Jul 02 11:57:25 <teena>	I'm not upset by it---to be honest, at least I know he likes SOMETHING 
Jul 02 11:57:31 <RammsteinFan>	men want something very different always
Jul 02 11:57:41 <RammsteinFan>	everyone gets tired of the same routien
Jul 02 11:57:50 <teena>	but to be honest...i asked you to look at my photo because i wanted you to tell me I wasn't unattractive.....
Jul 02 11:57:56 <teena>	then i'd know it isn't really ME
Jul 02 11:58:11 <RammsteinFan>	idk about that...im not the best judge 
Jul 02 11:58:12 <teena>	i know, but i'm adventurous
Jul 02 11:58:17 <teena>	it's HIM who won't do anything new
Jul 02 11:58:28 <RammsteinFan>	ah
Jul 02 11:58:29 <teena>	it's not just you---i've asked others
Jul 02 11:58:38 <RammsteinFan>	have you had attention from other men?
Jul 02 11:58:46 <RammsteinFan>	and what did they say?
Jul 02 11:58:52 <teena>	Some say i'm not very attractive, then some say i'm very attractive..so, it's not really helpful
Jul 02 11:59:08 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jul 02 11:59:18 <teena>	he never says I'm attractive...
Jul 02 11:59:28 <RammsteinFan>	did he say it earlier?
Jul 02 11:59:43 <teena>	....sometimes before we married....
Jul 02 11:59:48 <RammsteinFan>	ask him what changed
Jul 02 11:59:53 <teena>	i did
Jul 02 11:59:56 <RammsteinFan>	and?
Jul 02 12:00:04 <teena>	he said that this is the "new" him
Jul 02 12:00:08 <teena>	and I have to accept it
Jul 02 12:00:16 <RammsteinFan>	wow
Jul 02 12:00:24 <RammsteinFan>	i bet he meets other women outside
Jul 02 12:00:36 <teena>	someone else told me the same thing
Jul 02 12:00:37 <RammsteinFan>	hes just making excuses
Jul 02 12:00:55 <RammsteinFan>	you can start meeting other men outside
Jul 02 12:01:02 <RammsteinFan>	i know you dont want to
Jul 02 12:01:16 <RammsteinFan>	but stir up some ire in him 
Jul 02 12:01:21 <teena>	meeting other men is worse...when they find out you have a bad marriage, they treat you bad....
Jul 02 12:01:30 <RammsteinFan>	so dont tell them
Jul 02 12:01:31 <teena>	you now what?
Jul 02 12:01:35 <RammsteinFan>	what?
Jul 02 12:01:48 <teena>	when i was just released from the hospital, someone sent me flowers.
Jul 02 12:01:58 <RammsteinFan>	ok
Jul 02 12:02:00 <teena>	my husband didn't give me anything--no flowers---nothing
Jul 02 12:02:07 <RammsteinFan>	ouch
Jul 02 12:02:13 <teena>	so, it was very nice to get flowers from someone I didn't know
Jul 02 12:02:22 <teena>	but...that didn't bother him at all
Jul 02 12:02:23 <RammsteinFan>	why are you even marriedto him still?
Jul 02 12:02:26 <teena>	in FACT.....
Jul 02 12:02:36 <RammsteinFan>	yeah?
Jul 02 12:02:39 <teena>	i called my husband at work and thanked him because I thought he sent them
Jul 02 12:02:52 <RammsteinFan>	and?
Jul 02 12:03:07 <teena>	he just got angry and said he didn't know what i was talking about
Jul 02 12:03:14 <RammsteinFan>	i see
Jul 02 12:03:36 <teena>	but .....i thought maybe he would give me flowers after that, but he didn'.
Jul 02 12:03:44 <RammsteinFan>	yes
Jul 02 12:03:47 <RammsteinFan>	hes an ass
Jul 02 12:03:55 <teena>	he said he kept thinking about it, but kept forgetting
Jul 02 12:03:58 <RammsteinFan>	leave him...you are better off without him
Jul 02 12:04:03 *	teena shrugs
Jul 02 12:04:07 <teena>	i know.
Jul 02 12:04:16 <teena>	it's a sad existence
Jul 02 12:04:22 <teena>	i'm always trying to be a perfect wife
Jul 02 12:04:23 <RammsteinFan>	its better to have a life without an expectations...
Jul 02 12:04:29 <teena>	i know you've always thought I was a slut
Jul 02 12:04:33 <RammsteinFan>	oh no
Jul 02 12:04:38 <RammsteinFan>	i never thought you were
Jul 02 12:04:40 <teena>	but I just want you to know that i'm not
Jul 02 12:04:41 <RammsteinFan>	cmon 
Jul 02 12:04:46 <RammsteinFan>	i know you are not
Jul 02 12:04:56 <teena>	sometimes I just want to be wanted by someone
Jul 02 12:05:00 <RammsteinFan>	nothing wrong in having a big sex drive
Jul 02 12:05:05 <RammsteinFan>	people are people
Jul 02 12:05:12 <teena>	i know...but i can't do anything with it.
Jul 02 12:05:32 <RammsteinFan>	yes you cna...divorce the douche nad find another man
Jul 02 12:05:49 <teena>	i'm afraid....it could be even worse.
Jul 02 12:06:03 <teena>	I never thought i could have found someone who didn't appreciate me after my first husband
Jul 02 12:06:03 <RammsteinFan>	it would still be better than this isnt it?

Jul 02 12:07:45 <teena>	but that's not exactly true...
Jul 02 12:08:09 <teena>	the nights are long when you sleep with someone who isn't interested in you
